# September 8th, 2023 - Getting Started
I've begun to look at this project again, and it sounds interesting and a great way to learn for other future projects.

I'm looking through the data (Seattle Street Clock Database) and thinking through how to best clean and transform to make something presentable and not spin my wheels ***too*** much.

Some initial thoughts and a light "TODO":
- ensure each record has a city
- consider combining records of the same address (likely the best option, but consider first how you would iterate over multiple links to images for a single record)
- figure out how to acquire images
    - some are .jpgs which would be simple, others will take more work because they're hosted on a site
    - I'll need to develop some way to webscrape
- how will I store all of this? What will the database look like, and when it's hosted - how?

These are my principle thoughts right now, but I'll come back to this soon as I think more about it.
